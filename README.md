# Project Guidelines: Crowd Funding Website using MEAN Stack

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
The objective of this project is to design and develop a functional crowdfunding website using the MEAN stack. This project will allow students to learn full-stack web development and understand the functionality behind modern crowdfunding platforms.

### Background
Crowdfunding platforms connect project creators with potential backers, facilitating funding for innovative ideas and community-driven projects. Examples include Kickstarter and GoFundMe. The MEAN stack is an efficient framework for building web applications with consistent JavaScript language usage on both client and server sides.

### Scope
The project will cover:
- User registration and authentication.
- Campaign creation and management by users.
- Donation functionality for backers.
- Real-time campaign updates and analytics.
- Responsive design and user experience.
